# Obervation: the Agile Manifesto

The manifesto exposes 4 values written in the same form:
&lt;X&gt; over &lt;Y&gt;
where X is a value (or set of values) that comes other Y.

We will focus on X and have no discussion on Y in this paper. 

# First value : Individuals and interactions

 In a development team, how can the code be a medium between individuals and ease interactions?
In an agile perspective (or an agile ideal), the developement team, often mentionned as 'the team', should include: testers, ergonomists, front end developpers, back end devs, data specialists, devOps engineers, technical leaders, architects and so on.

The aspect of sharing informations with the end users (aka customers) is exposed in the third value.

## Express Knowledge
Modelisation: what model is easy to share and interact with?  Which consequences for the code?

## Shared Knowledge
Event Storming as a recipe.

## ATDD and BDD

## Code Reviews

## Sprint Review


## Decision Records

## Using Maps

## Interactions in code: it's all about dependencies

# Second value : Working software 

How can we ensure that the software is working?

## Difference between V&V and tests

## Validations and Verifications

### The tests pyramid

### Unit tests 

## Tests: a human factor

## On the feedback loop


# Third value : Customer collaboration 

What are the elements that the code can provide to improve collaboration with the Customers?

## Toward an Ubiquitous Language

## Human Readable code

## Domain Modeling

## Human Readable Verification

# Fourth value : Responding to change

How can the code help us to facilitate any responses to change?

Quote: "Make the change easy, the make the easy change" (Kent Beck).

## Nature of changes

## Architectures enabling changes

## Verifications enabling changes

## Insurances that changes are not breaking

## Evolutions in code
When changes are evolution, how to cope with it?
